# GM Agent Improvements (v2.1.0)

## Overview

The phone icon on token controls has been significantly improved for GM functionality. Previously, GMs would see a list of all devices with many showing "(Unknown)" labels, which was confusing and not useful. The new system provides a much cleaner and more intuitive experience.

## What Changed

### Before (v2.0.0)
- GM always saw a phone icon on token controls
- Clicking the icon showed ALL devices in the system
- Many devices showed "(Unknown)" labels
- No filtering based on ownership or equipment status
- Confusing interface with irrelevant devices

### After (v2.1.0)
- GM sees phone icon only for characters with equipped Agents that they own
- Clicking the icon shows only equipped Agents from owned characters
- All devices show proper character names
- Consistent logic between GM and players
- Clean, relevant interface

## How It Works

### For Players (Unchanged)
1. Player equips an Agent item on their character
2. Phone icon appears on token controls
3. If one Agent equipped: opens directly
4. If multiple Agents equipped: shows selection menu
5. Only shows Agents from characters the player owns

### For GMs (Improved)
1. GM equips Agent items on characters they own
2. Phone icon appears on token controls for those characters
3. If one Agent equipped: opens directly
4. If multiple Agents equipped: shows selection menu
5. Only shows equipped Agents from characters the GM owns

## Key Benefits

### 1. No More "(Unknown)" Labels
- All devices show proper character names
- Clean, professional interface
- No confusion about device ownership

### 2. Consistent Logic
- Same behavior for GM and players
- Based on equipment status, not arbitrary access
- Predictable and intuitive

### 3. Ownership-Based Access
- GM only sees devices from characters they own
- Respects FoundryVTT ownership system
- Secure and appropriate access control

### 4. Automatic vs Manual Selection
- Single Agent: Opens automatically (convenient)
- Multiple Agents: Shows selection menu (flexible)
- Reduces clicks for common use case

## Technical Implementation

### Core Functions Updated

#### `addControlButton(controls)`
- Removed GM-specific logic that showed all devices
- Now uses `getEquippedAgentsForUser()` for both GM and players
- Consistent button behavior across user types

#### `openAgentInterface()`
- Simplified to use same logic for GM and players
- Removed complex device filtering logic
- Uses equipped agents list for all users

#### `getEquippedAgentsForUser()`
- Already worked correctly for both GM and players
- Filters by ownership and equipment status
- Returns properly labeled devices

### Device Filtering Logic

```javascript
// Old logic (removed)
if (game.user.isGM) {
    // Show all devices (caused "Unknown" labels)
    const accessibleDevices = this.getUserAccessibleDevices();
    // ... complex device selection logic
}

// New logic (unified)
const equippedAgents = this.getEquippedAgentsForUser();
// Works for both GM and players
// Only shows equipped agents from owned characters
```

## Migration Guide

### For Existing GMs
1. **No action required** - the system will work automatically
2. **Equip Agents** on characters you want to access
3. **Phone icons will appear** only for equipped Agents
4. **Clean interface** - no more "(Unknown)" devices

### For New GMs
1. **Equip Agent items** on your characters
2. **Phone icons appear** on token controls
3. **Click to access** your equipped Agents
4. **Multiple Agents** show selection menu

## Testing

Use the test script to verify the improvements:

```javascript
// In browser console
const tester = new TestGMAgentImprovements();
tester.runTests();
```

The test script will:
- Check equipped agents for current user
- Verify user actors and ownership
- Test device filtering logic
- Validate token controls behavior

## Backward Compatibility

- ✅ **Fully backward compatible**
- ✅ **No breaking changes**
- ✅ **Existing data preserved**
- ✅ **Same API functions**

## Future Considerations

The improvements provide a foundation for:
- Better device management
- Role-based access control
- Enhanced GM tools
- Improved user experience

## Support

If you encounter any issues with the GM improvements:
1. Check that Agents are properly equipped
2. Verify character ownership settings
3. Run the test script to diagnose issues
4. Report bugs with detailed information
