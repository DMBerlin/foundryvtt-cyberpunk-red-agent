# Contact Sorting by Latest Message

## Overview

The Cyberpunk Agent now features dynamic contact sorting based on the latest message timestamp, similar to popular messaging apps like WhatsApp and Telegram. This ensures that contacts with the most recent conversations appear at the top of the contact list, making it easier to find active conversations.

## Features

### ðŸ”„ **Dynamic Ordering**
- Contacts are automatically sorted by their latest message timestamp
- Most recent conversations appear at the top
- Contacts with no messages appear at the bottom
- Order updates in real-time when new messages are sent or received

### ðŸ“± **WhatsApp/Telegram-like Behavior**
- Mimics the familiar behavior of modern messaging apps
- When you send or receive a message, that contact moves to the top
- Provides intuitive navigation through active conversations

### âš¡ **Real-time Updates**
- Leverages the existing real-time update system
- No page refresh required - updates happen instantly
- Works seamlessly with the current SocketLib integration

## Implementation Details

### Location
The sorting logic is implemented in `scripts/agent-home.js` within the `getData()` method for the Chat7 view (lines 100-127).

### How It Works

1. **Message Timestamp Retrieval**: For each contact, the system retrieves all messages in the conversation and finds the most recent one
2. **Timestamp Assignment**: Each contact gets a `latestMessageTimestamp` property
3. **Sorting**: Contacts are sorted by this timestamp in descending order (most recent first)
4. **Real-time Updates**: When new messages arrive, the existing real-time system triggers a re-render with updated sorting

### Code Implementation

```javascript
// Get the latest message timestamp for this conversation
let latestMessageTimestamp = 0;
try {
  const messages = window.CyberpunkAgent?.instance?.getMessagesForDeviceConversation(this.device.id, contactDeviceId) || [];
  if (messages.length > 0) {
    // Find the most recent message
    const latestMessage = messages.reduce((latest, current) => 
      current.timestamp > latest.timestamp ? current : latest
    );
    latestMessageTimestamp = latestMessage.timestamp;
  }
} catch (error) {
  console.warn(`Cyberpunk Agent | Error getting latest message timestamp for contact ${contactDeviceId}:`, error);
}

// Sort contacts by latest message timestamp (most recent first)
// Contacts with no messages will have timestamp 0 and appear at the bottom
contactsWithData.sort((a, b) => b.latestMessageTimestamp - a.latestMessageTimestamp);
```

## Behavior Examples

### Scenario 1: Initial State
```
Contact List:
1. Alice (no messages) - timestamp: 0
2. Bob (no messages) - timestamp: 0
3. Charlie (no messages) - timestamp: 0
```

### Scenario 2: After Bob sends a message
```
Contact List:
1. Bob (just messaged) - timestamp: 1640995800000
2. Alice (no messages) - timestamp: 0
3. Charlie (no messages) - timestamp: 0
```

### Scenario 3: After Charlie sends a message
```
Contact List:
1. Charlie (most recent) - timestamp: 1640995900000
2. Bob (older message) - timestamp: 1640995800000
3. Alice (no messages) - timestamp: 0
```

## Integration with Existing Systems

### âœ… **Compatible Features**
- **Unread Count System**: Works seamlessly with existing unread message counts
- **Mute System**: Muted contacts are still sorted by latest message
- **Real-time Updates**: Uses existing SocketLib integration for instant updates
- **Contact Management**: All existing contact management features remain unchanged
- **UI Controllers**: Compatible with existing UI update mechanisms

### âœ… **No Breaking Changes**
- All existing functionality is preserved
- No changes to templates or CSS required
- No changes to the database structure
- No impact on performance (sorting happens in memory)

## Performance Considerations

- **Efficient Sorting**: O(n log n) complexity for sorting contacts
- **Cached Messages**: Uses existing message cache for optimal performance  
- **Minimal Overhead**: Only processes messages when rendering the contact list
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if message retrieval fails

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive tests in `__tests__/test-contact-sorting-by-latest-message.js`:

- âœ… Basic sorting functionality
- âœ… Dynamic reordering when new messages arrive
- âœ… Proper handling of contacts with no messages
- âœ… Edge cases and error scenarios

## Manual Testing

To test the feature manually:

1. Open the Cyberpunk Agent in FoundryVTT
2. Navigate to the Chat7 view
3. Send messages to different contacts
4. Observe that contacts automatically reorder
5. The contact you just messaged should appear at the top
6. Contacts with no message history should appear at the bottom

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements could include:

- **Pinned Contacts**: Option to pin important contacts to the top
- **Custom Sorting**: User preference for different sorting methods
- **Group Conversations**: Enhanced sorting for group chats
- **Last Seen Indicators**: Show when contacts were last online

## Conclusion

This feature significantly improves the user experience by providing familiar, intuitive contact ordering that matches modern messaging app conventions. The implementation is robust, performant, and fully integrated with the existing Cyberpunk Agent architecture.
